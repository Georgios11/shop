# Shop Application

A modern full-stack e-commerce application built with cutting-edge technologies. This application delivers a lightning-fast shopping experience through optimized performance and responsive design.

## Log in Credentials

To explore the different user roles and their permissions, you can use the following test accounts:

-   **Admin Account**

    -   Email: admin@email.com
    -   Password: 121212
    -   Full access to all features including admin dashboard

-   **Regular User Account**

    -   Email: user2@email.com
    -   Password: 121212
    -   Standard user access with shopping features

-   **Banned User Account**
    -   Email: user@email.com
    -   Password: 121212
    -   Demonstrates restricted access and error handling

Try logging in with different accounts to see how the application handles various user roles and permissions.

## Registration

You can also register as a new user using your own email address to create a new account

## Authentication & Authorization Demonstration

This application is intentionally designed to demonstrate authentication and authorization concepts in a clear, educational manner. Some UI elements and behaviors are deliberately simplified or exaggerated to make these concepts more visible:

-   The navigation bar displays both "User" and "Admin" buttons regardless of the user's role
-   When a regular user attempts to access admin routes, they are redirected to a "Forbidden" page
-   This design choice makes the authorization flow more transparent and easier to understand
-   It serves as a practical example of how role-based access control (RBAC) works in real applications

These intentional design choices are meant to:

-   Make authentication/authorization concepts more visible and understandable
-   Provide clear examples of how different user roles interact with the system
-   Demonstrate proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
-   Show how frontend and backend work together to enforce security policies

In a production environment, these elements would be more subtle and user-specific, but for educational purposes, they are made more explicit to better illustrate the underlying concepts.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm (v9 or higher)
-   MongoDB (local or Atlas)
-   Redis (via WSL for Windows users)

## Quick Start

1.**Environment Setup**

-   Create `.env` in `api/`:
    -   Use .env.example
-   Create `.env` in `client/`:
    -   Use .env.example

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    cd client && npm install
    cd ../api && npm install
    ```

3. **Start Redis (Required)**

    ```bash
    # Open WSL terminal and run:
    redis-server
    ```

    **Keep this terminal open while running the application.**

4. **Start the Application**

    Open two separate terminal windows:

    **Terminal 1 - API Server:**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to api directory
    cd api

    # Start the server
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    Wait until you see "App is running at http://localhost:3001"

    **Terminal 2 - Client:**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to client directory
    cd client

    # Start the client
    npm run dev
    ```

## Accessing the Application

-   Frontend: http://localhost:5174
-   Backend API: http://localhost:3001
-   API Documentation: http://localhost:3001/api-docs

## Important Notes

1. Always start Redis in WSL before running the application
2. Start the API server first, then the client
3. Keep all three terminals open:
    - WSL terminal running Redis
    - Terminal running the API server
    - Terminal running the client

## Troubleshooting

1. **Redis Connection Issues**

    - Ensure Redis is running in WSL
    - Check if Redis is accessible on port 6379

2. **API Server Issues**

    - Verify MongoDB connection
    - Check if port 3001 is available
    - Ensure all environment variables are set

3. **Client Issues**
    - Clear browser cache
    - Check if the API server is running
    - Verify environment variables

## API Documentation with Swagger

The API is fully documented using Swagger/OpenAPI, providing:

-   Interactive API documentation
-   Request/response examples
-   Authentication requirements
-   Schema definitions
-   Try-it-out functionality

### Accessing Swagger Documentation

1. Start the API server:

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm run start:dev
    ```

2. Open Swagger UI in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:3001/api-docs
    ```

### Using Swagger UI

The API documentation is powered by Swagger UI, providing an interactive interface to explore and test all available endpoints. Here's how to make the most of it:

1. **Accessing the Documentation**

    - Start the API server: `cd api && npm run start:dev`
    - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`

2. **Getting Started**

    - The documentation is organized by tags (e.g., Auth, Products, Orders)
    - Each endpoint shows:
        - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        - Required parameters and request body
        - Response schemas
        - Authentication requirements
        - Example requests and responses

3. **Authentication**

    - Authentication is handled through the login endpoints
    - Use the Auth endpoints to:
        - Login with your credentials
        - The server will return a JWT token in the response
    - Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints

4. **Testing Endpoints**

    - Click on any endpoint to expand its details
    - Use the "Try it out" button to:
        - Fill in required parameters
        - Modify request body
        - Execute the request
        - View the response

5. **Available Test Credentials**

    - **Admin Access:**
        - Email: admin@email.com
        - Password: 121212
    - **User Access:**
        - Email: user2@email.com
        - Password: 121212
    - **Banned User (for testing):**
        - Email: user@email.com
        - Password: 121212

6. **Important Notes**

    - Always seed the database first using the Seed endpoint
    - Some endpoints may require specific roles (admin, user, guest)
    - Check the response schemas for expected data structures
    - Use the "Model" section to understand data types

7. **Common Operations**
    - **Authentication:**
        - Register new user
        - Login to get JWT token
        - Refresh token
    - **Products:**
        - Browse products
        - Filter and search
        - Add to cart
    - **Orders:**
        - Create orders
        - View order history
        - Track order status

For detailed information about each endpoint, refer to the specific documentation in Swagger UI. The interface provides real-time validation and helps you understand the API's capabilities.

## Testing Strategy

The application implements a robust testing strategy using modern testing tools and best practices:

### Testing Tools

-   **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner with native TypeScript support
-   **React Testing Library**: User-centric testing utilities
-   **User Event**: Simulates real user interactions

### Component Testing

Components are thoroughly tested with a focus on user interactions and accessibility. For example, the `CreateProductForm` component tests demonstrate our testing approach:

-   **Form Validation Testing**

    -   Validates required fields
    -   Tests error message display
    -   Ensures proper form submission behavior

-   **User Interaction Testing**

    -   Simulates user input
    -   Tests file upload functionality
    -   Verifies loading states
    -   Validates form submission

-   **Integration Testing**
    -   Tests component integration with hooks
    -   Verifies data fetching behavior
    -   Ensures proper state management

### Test Coverage

Tests are written to cover:

-   Component rendering
-   User interactions
-   Form validation
-   Error handling
-   Loading states
-   File uploads
-   Integration with custom hooks

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
